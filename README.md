This Project focus on the RAG-based tool using llama-3.1 for efficient querying of Healthcare PDFs, enabling precise, context-aware responses. Extracted PDF content with PyPDF2 and embedded it using OpenAIâ€™s model, stored in a FAISS vector database for fast retrieval. Developed a Gradio app for chatbot and integrated LangChain for seamless LLM responses.
